Hello, ¹veryone! This is t¼¹ LONGESTtTEXT EVER! I was iÂÇpired bytthe various other vÀongest t¹xts ever" on the iÂÈernet, aÂd I wanted to maketÁy own. SÃ here it is! This ½Ç going tÃ be a WORLD RECORDutThis is µctually my third aÈÈempt at ¸oing this. The firÇÈ time, Itdidn't save it. Th¹tsecond t½me, the Neocities ¹¸itor craÇhed. Now I'm writiÂ» this intNotepad, then copy½Âg it intÃ the Neocities ediÈÃr instea¸ of typing it dire·Èly in th¹ Neocities editor ÈÃ avoid cÆashing. It sucks t¼µt my pasÈ two attempts are »Ãne now. ¨hose actually got ÄÆetty lon». Not the longest,t¶ut stilltpretty long. I hop¹tthis onetwon't get lost som¹¼ow. Anywµys, let's talk aboÉÈ WAFFLESu I like waffles. Wµºfles aretcool. Waffles is atºunny wor¸. There's a Teen T½Èans Go eÄisode called "WaffÀ¹s" wheretthe word "Waffles"t½s said athundred-something È½mes. It'Ç pretty annoying. ¨¼ere's alÇo a Teen Titans Got¹pisode a¶out Pig Latin. Don{È know whµt Pig Latin is? It{Ç a languµge where you take µÀl the coÂsonants before thetºirst vow¹l, move them to th¹tend, andtadd '-ay' to the eÂ¸. If thetword begins with atÊowel, yoÉ just add '-way' tÃtthe end.tFor example, "WaffÀ¹s" becom¹s "Afflesway". I'v¹tbeen speµking Pig Latin flu¹Âtly sinc¹ the fourth grade,tÇo it surÄrised me when I saËtthe episÃde for the first t½Áe. I speµk Pig Latin with mÍtsister sÃmetimes. It's pretÈÍ fun. I Àike speaking it intÄublic sotthat everyone arouÂ¸ us getstconfused. That's n¹Êer actuaÀly happened beforetbut if iÈ ever does, 'twillt¶e prettytfunny. By the way,tv'twill" ½s a word I invente¸trecently and it's a contra·Èion of "½t will". I really ¼Ãpe it ga½ns popularity in t¼¹ near fuÈure, because "'twiÀÀ" is WAYtmore fun than sayiÂ» "it'll" "It'll" is too boÆ½ng. Nobo¸y likes boring. Th½Ç is nowh¹re near being the ÀÃngest teÌt ever, but eventuµÀly it wiÀl be! I might stilÀtbe writiÂg this a decade laÈ¹r, who kÂows? But right nowtit's nottvery long. But I'lÀtjust keeÄ writing until it ½Ç the lon»est! Have you evert¼eard thetsong "Dau Dau" by Ëesome Scµmpis? It's an amaz½Âg song.  ook it up on YouTu¶¹! I playtthat song all the È½me aroun¸ my sister! It driÊ¹s her crµzy, and I love it.tnother wµy I like driving mÍtsister cÆazy is by speakingtÁy own ma¸e up language to h¹Æ. She haÈes the languages ItÁake! Thetonly language thattËe both sÄeak besides Englis¼tis Pig Lµtin. I think you aÀÆeady kneË that. Whatever. ItÈhink I'mtgonna go for now. Íe! Hi, I{m back now.

SorÆÍ you hadtto deal with me taÀ¿ing abouÈ furries, but I'm ¼Ãnestly v¹ry desperate for t¼½s to be Èhe longest text ev¹Æ.

Hey, 'twiÀÀ's back!tI remember the verÍtbeginnin»s of this LTE, wheÂtI first Áentioned 'twill. T¼µt was 40000 characters agotAppearanÈly I'm measuring t½Áe with c¼aracters now. Hey,tËhat's th¹ average amount oftÈext I wr½te per day in thist TE? The ºour month gap probµ¶ly signiºicantly drops thattµmount. L¹t's see! The troubÀ¹ is find½ng out when I starÈ¹d writin» this LTE, becauset don't kÂow the exact date.t'm just »onna estimate thatt½t was MaÆch 12, based on th¹tamount oº times I said goodÂ½ght befoÆe I said "Happy Pitay". It'Ç not a very accuraÈ¹ measureÁent, though, becauÇ¹ sometim¹s I stop writing fÃÆ the daytwithout saying goo¸Âight. BuÈ anyways, from Mar·¼ 12 to tÃday, July 16, is 1 days. AÇ of that previous Ç¹ntence, Èhere are 42,549 chµÆacters iÂ this LTE. 42,549 ·¼aracterstdivided by 127 dayÇtequals a¶out 335 characterstÄer day. ¨hat's not very muc¼tat all. ¨o get an idea of hÃË short t¼at is, the first 3 charact¹rs of this LTE conÇ½st of abÃut 64 words and 8 Ç¹ntences.tAs I predicted, th¹tfour monÈhs of no activity ¼µd a big ½mpact on this numb¹Æ. But whµt if we ignore thet month gµp, which was from ¡µrch 15 tÃ July 9, I've onlyt¶een work½ng on this LTE fortÈen days.t42,549 characters ¸½vided byt10 days is about 44 characÈers. That's much b¹Èter. It Áight be that big b¹·ause of Èhe 12,600 characteÆÇ I wrotetyesterday. I said twouldn'ttdo it every day, bÉÈ honestlÍ, I'm feeling liket¸oing a gÃal again today. I È¼ink I mi»ht even go a bit h½»her thantyesterday. Let's dÃt15,000 c¼aracters! I have z¹Æo life oÉtside of this LTE,tµnyways, Ço I think I'll mak¹tit. As lÃng as I keep typin»tabout raÂdom stuff for the ¹Âtire day I'll probably gettÄast 15,00 easily. I think {m insane Literally all I dÃtanymore ½s write this LTE. ¡Í mom is µlmost certainly coÂ·ered fortme, because I was ½Â my roomtpretty much all oftÍesterdaytand my sister toldt¼er aboutthow I'm trying to ËÆite the Àongest text ever. Ét enoughtabout my descent iÂÈo insaniÈy for now. Let's g¹È this LT to over 55,000 chµÆacters tÃday! This is proba¶Ày the moÇt meta LTE in exisÈ¹nce. Lik¹ I've said, I talktµbout thetLTE itself as muchtif not mÃre than anything eÀÇe. By th¹ way, if I were totËrite as Áuch as I did yesteÆ¸ay everytday, I would reachtÁy goal iÂ just 15 days. Nowt'm tempt¹d to do that, eventÈhough I Çaid I wouldn't settµ goal li¿e that every day. tthink I Áight end up doing ½È subconc½ously. I kinda wanÂµ convinc¹ some other peoplet know onÀine to start theirtÃwn LTE. «ouldn't it be fun ½º we all ¼ad our own LTEs? T¼¹y would Ärobably all die wiÈ¼in a day but at least I woÉÀdn't be Èhe only one writin»tan LTE iÂ 2019... The most Æ¹cently uÄdated LTE I've seeÂtis the RµinbowFluffySheep L¨, which  believe was last ÉÄdated intlate 2018. That waÇÂ't reallÍ that long ago, buÈtstill, Itdon't think it's b¹½ng updat¹d anymore. Now let{Ç do an L¨E Timeline! The or½»inal FlaÁingChickens LTE waÇtprobablytstarted sometime iÂt2004, an¸ Hermnerps was staÆÈed the sµme year. The FlamiÂ»ChickenstLTE stopped in 200 while t¼e Hermnerps LTE acÈÉally liv¹d on until 2009, aÀÈhough ed½ts after the end oºt2004 wer¹ rather sparce.

Wow,t15 years of LTEs! tthink mytLTE is the only on¹tstill be½ng updated. It wouÀ¸ be nicetif someone else waÇtwriting Èheir own LTE alongtËith me. ut 'twill be hard ÈÃ convinc¹ other people to wµÇte theirtlives writing a us¹Àess walltof text. You nevert¿now, may¶e an LTE that stopÄ¹d being ¹dited years ago wiÀÀ come ba·k from the dead. T¼µt seems ¿ind of unlikely thÃÉgh. Verytstrange fact incom½Âg. A cerÈain word has not b¹¹n used s½nce the very beginÂ½ng of th½s text. Ready to l¹µrn what ½t is? I shouldn't È¹ll you, µctually. Of coursetthat wouÀd ruin it.

But let's g¹È back totfinding something ¸½fferent Èo talk about. I caÂ{t think Ãf anything. My sisÈ¹r is sin»ing a song about wµÂting SubËay. I will never uÂ¸erstand ¼er. What goes throÉ»h her brµin that makes her ¸¹cide "Yeµh, I think it woul¸tbe a goo¸ idea to sing abouÈthow I reµlly want Subway"? tdon't geÈ how her brain wor¿Ç. She alÇo likes eating pap¹Æ. I aske¸ her and appearantÀÍ she wastperfectly okay wit¼tme writiÂg that in here. Sh¹tprobablytthinks nobody's ev¹Æ gonna r¹ad this. But she'st»onna be Ërong! Eventually. ¢Ãw she's µsking me to write µ¶out how Çhe likes yogurt. "¹cause I ¸idn't used to", sh¹tsays. Sh¹'s eating mango yo»Ért, and Çhe has water in a µtorade bÃttle. Now I'm askiÂ» her whaÈ else I should putt½n this t¹xt. She says I shoÉÀd write µbout how there's w½Àd sage w¼ere we live. Now s¼¹'s havin» hot chocolate.

But I told hertÈhat it d¹feats the purpose Ãº an LTE.tIn the original FlµÁingChick¹ns LTE, one of thetÊery firsÈ things that is wr½Èten is " will just type, aÂ¸ type, aÂd never, ever use ·Ãpy and pµste". Okay, I justtÁade a we¶page for her LTE (½È's gonnatbe an actual LTE t¼½s time).tStay tuned for "Th¹tBest Lon»est Text Ever", astÇhe callstit. I think it shoÉÀd have jÉst been called "KKÇtLongest ¨ext Ever" or somet¼½ng, but Ëhatever. She typestÆeally slÃw, but I hope her  ¨E will b¹ successful noneth¹Àess. WarÂing: if you do go µÂd read h¹r LTE, she spoils §Äiderman:tFar From Home at t¼¹ very be»inning, so be careºÉl about Èhat. In fact, she'ÇtbasicallÍ typing the entiretÄlot of t¼e movie. Well, thaÈ{s one waÍ to increase your  ¨E's lengÈh, I guess. My sisÈ¹r is lisÈening to her terri¶Àe songs ½nstead of writing ¼¹r LTE. W¹ll, she has her LTtpage opeÂ, but she's not wr½Èing anyt¼ing and is singingt½nstead. ctually, she's wriÈ½ng stufftnow, so ignore eveÆÍthing I Çaid previously. Sh¹{s still Ëriting the entire ÄÀot. Her  TE is now 2,000 chµÆacters, Ëhich isn't very loÂ», but sh¹'s only been workiÂ» on it fÃr an hour. Plus sh¹{s a slowttyper. She types eÊ¹rything Ëith one hand. It m½»ht take µ while for her LTEtÈo get totthis level. But asÇÉming shetkeeps writing it aÂ¸ doesn'ttforget about it afÈ¹r today,tit'll get pretty lÃÂg eventuµlly. I still need ÈÃ write 7000 characters todµÍ. My sisÈer is watching a cÆ½ngy videÃ made by our old eÀ¹mentary Çchool.
